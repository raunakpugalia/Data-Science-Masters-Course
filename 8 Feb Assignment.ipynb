    "Abstraction refers to the act of representing essential features without including the background details. In other words, abstraction is \n",

    "Encapsulation, on the other hand, is a technique used to protect the data inside an object from being modified by external code.\n",

    "combustion process, or how the transmission system operates. This is abstraction.\n",
